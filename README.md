# How to Run Typescript?

**TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing, but it requires a TypeScript compiler to be used.**

First of all, you have to install the Typescript in the terminal.

    npm install -g typescript

After installed, use the command below to make sure the Typescript was installed.

    tsc -v

With Typescript, you can compile your .ts file into .js file.

    tsc ./example.ts

You will find a new example.js file created in the same folder of your example.ts. Now, use node to run the script.

    node ./example.js
